The CHICAS Spatial Statistics Reading group is a student-led initiative with the aim of sharing skills, knowledge and solutions to common issues among the postgraduate students of CHICAS. The focus of the group is in spatial statistics, in the widest sense, and its applications to problems of medical sciences. We also welcome anyone who would like to bring topics in infectious disease modelling.

* The group will meet fortnightly and will discuss a variety of statistical challenges: How do I implement this model in R? What is the best approach to analyse this data? Help me to understand this paper!

* The goal of the group is to create a motivating and friendly research environment that will foster active collaboration among PhD students.
The group is also open to research associates. Lecturers and other members of staff may also be invited to attend some of the meeting sessions.

* The group is currently planning to host a website on Github to arrange meetings, share software material, papers and create a discussion forum.
