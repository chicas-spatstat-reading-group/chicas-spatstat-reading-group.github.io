##Tips for Work-Along Facilitators

The **Work-Along** is a skill-sharing session, where one group member demonstrates how they use a particular piece of code, tool, or other skill in their research, while everyone else follows along. It’s best if all members have laptops to work on, and the person who’s demonstrating can project their own screen for easy viewing. Work-alongs help your community discover new tools and see novel solutions to common problems. 


**Time Required:** 1+ hours to prepare; event time: 1 hour 

**Tips for Work-Along presenters**

* **Start with a good plan and notes.** Outline your plan for the work-along task, the steps in that task, and how you’ll introduce it. Context and background is helpful for new learners, so before you jump in with technical details and tasks, explain how this tool/or skill is useful, give an example of how it might be used, and come prepared with jargon-free definitions of any new terms. Use this template for organizing your notes. 
* **Keep it short.** An hour is plenty; focus on the basics to avoid overwhelming beginners.
* **Keep it simple.** That hour will go by really fast, so don’t try to cram too much in! There's no final exam; if people walk away with a successful first couple of steps on the topic, that's all they need to get started and learn more in future.
* **Keep beginners on board.** Explicitly illustrate every step, and go slow enough for participants to copy everything you're doing. Check in often and stop if people seem lost.
* **Use very few slides.** This is NOT a lecture! You should frame the concept in a few slides maximum or with a brief verbal intro, but the rest of the presentation should be a live-demonstration, where participants are fully engaged.
* **Give people challenge problems.** Take breaks from the guided demonstration to let your students try their new skills on a problem or mini-project. 
* **Keep it real.** Show how you actually use the tool in your research; this way, everyone will understand not only how to use it, but why it's valuable in real practice.
* **Empathize with new learners.**  If you’re skilled in this topic, remember what it was like when YOU were first learning it. Where did you get stuck? What was most confusing, and what helped you through? Revisiting a new learner’s mindset can help you teach. 
* **Post the lesson notes.** It takes some work to prepare the notes for a lesson, so make good use of them! Put them in a GitHub repository and share them back with the community.
