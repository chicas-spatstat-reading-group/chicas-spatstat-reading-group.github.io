##Tips for Hacky Hour Hosts

**The Hacky Hour** is an informal, social get-together where community members meet one another, discuss new ideas, and build the social ties that help strengthen any community. Hacky Hours are the easiest events to organize, since all that's required is an open cafe or pub, and a bunch of people! As Hacky Hour host, you’ll be focused on welcoming attendees, and making introductions and connections among attendees.


**Time Required:** minimal time to prepare (sending out invites);  event time: flexible


**Tips for Hacky Hour Hosts:**


* **Invite people! Lots of People.** In the weeks before the event, let people know they’re welcome to attend. Whenever anyone mentions a coding project, needs help with a bug, or seems curious about your Study Group, invite them to your Hacky Hour! It’s a fun, low-pressure way for newbies to meet your community.
* **Choose the right place.** A pub or cafe at or near your institution, with seats and decent lighting. A spot that’s quiet enough for conversation is best. When the weather is good, patios or outdoor seating areas are spots for Hacky Hours.
* **Choose the right time.** A little before the venue’s busy hours are best, usually around 3 or 4 pm on a weekday evening (if it works with members’ schedules). Thursdays or Fridays are great because people are ready to unwind at the end of the workweek. 
* **Switch up the Schedule.** Hold your Hacky Hour on a different day and/or time than your usual Group meetings.  having a hacky hour outside your usual meeting times will give new and differnent people the chance to come say hi.
* **Make it obvious.** Make sure it's easy for newcomers to identify who the Hacky Hour group is at the venue; funny hats can go a long way.
* **Make introductions.**  Keep an eye out for people who might have interests in common, and help make connections.
