##Tips for Co-Working or Help/Q&A Sessions

**The Co-Working session** or **Help/Q&A session** is an an open session where members work on separate projects, but help each other with problems and questions, and share successes. Co-working sessions are easy to run, and the format encourages collaboration, skill-sharing, and hands-on problem-solving in a casual, low-pressure environment… all while members to make progress on their own work!


**Time Required:** no time to prepare; event time: 2 hours


**Tips for Co-Working Session Facilitators:**


* **Start with introductions.** Ask each member to say their name and give a short, capsule summary of what each member is working on. These should be just a sentence or two, covering what the tools or tech the member is using, and what chunk of work or problem they hope to solve during the session. 
* **Make connections.** As facilitator, if you have a good understanding of the skills and interests in the group, you might point out (especially to newcomers) who might be a good helper or collaborator on a problem or task.
* **Encourage questions and sharing.** While a good portion of this session is independent work time, it’s important that members feel like they can start side conversations and ask questions. As facilitator, you can model this by checking in and asking members about their work.
* **Wrap up by sharing progress.** At the end of the session, give people a chance to show what they were working on, and share successes or anything that came up in the session. These should be quick (2 minute) demonstrations of a chunk of code or a feature, to get group members familiar with others’ projects.
